# ICU Patient Mortality Prediction: A NIGMS Study
A machine learning workup of PhysioNet's 2012 challenge

The hallmarks of a successful pathway out of the ICU are hard to spot. A lot of time and money are wasted allocating resources to ICUs that simply cannot handle the volume. This model seeks to help both doctors and administrators provide premium care by predicting ICU outcomes.
•	Converted raw big data text files to DataFrame data in the Gigabyte size range
•	Visualized distributions of patient biomarkers over multiple hospital visits 

## Problem Statement

## Methods Used

## Conclusions

Predicting patient outcome is a hard thing to do. So, we stuck to a more descriptive model. We tried to visualize outcomes 

## Future Work

The future work includes:
- Combining with other datasets; NIGMS and Brendt University just released their shared repository (as of August, 2020)
- Look at other predictive models
- Cite relevant research
